## Overview of the Work

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   The dataset was loaded and inspected for missing values, which were filled with the mean of the columns. Categorical variables such as `gender`, `country`, and `game_genre` were label-encoded for modeling purposes.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Descriptive statistics were computed to understand the distribution of features. Visualizations like count plots for churn distribution and box plots for key features (`total_play_time`, `avg_session_time`) were created to explore their relationships with churn.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Numerical features such as `total_play_time`, `avg_session_time`, and `in_game_purchases` were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform scaling across the model. This step ensures better performance, especially for distance-based algorithms.

### 4. **Train-Test Split**  
   The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and 20% for testing. This allows us to train models on one portion of the data and evaluate their performance on unseen data.

### 5. **Model Training**  
   Two models were trained to predict user churn:
   - **Logistic Regression**: A linear classification model to predict whether a user will churn.
   - **Random Forest**: A tree-based ensemble method that captures complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Both models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to compare their performance. The Random Forest model performed better overall, capturing the complex relationships between the features and the churn outcome.

 ### 7. **Feature Importance**  
   The most important features contributing to the Random Forest model's predictions were identified and visualized. These insights reveal the factors most strongly influencing user churn, such as `total_play_time` and `games_played`.

# Game User Churn Prediction and Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze user churn in a gaming environment by leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis. The dataset consists of 10,000 entries and 20 features, including demographic, behavioral, and engagement metrics. The objective is to predict whether a user will churn (stop playing) and to identify key factors contributing to churn.

The project is broken down into the following steps: data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
- **Process**: The dataset was loaded using `pandas`. Missing values were handled by filling in the mean of each column. Categorical columns such as `gender`, `country`, `game_genre`, `subscription_status`, `device_type`, and `favorite_game_mode` were label-encoded to prepare them for modeling.
  
  ```python
  df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
  label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
  for column in ['gender', 'country', 'game_genre', 'subscription_status', 'device_type', 'favorite_game_mode']:
      df[column] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df[column].astype(str))
  ```

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Process**: Initial data exploration provided insights into the distribution of the churn rate, with a mean churn rate of approximately 0.31 (31%).
  
  **Key Visualizations:**
  - **Churn Distribution**: A bar chart showed the ratio of churned to non-churned users.
  - **Feature Relationships**: Box plots were created to visualize the relationships between total playtime, average session time, and churn.
  
  ```python
  sns.countplot(x='churn', data=df)
  sns.boxplot(x='churn', y='total_play_time', data=df)
  sns.boxplot(x='churn', y='avg_session_time', data=df)
  ```

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- **Process**: Numerical columns were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform scaling for the models. Feature engineering was applied to transform columns such as total playtime, session time, and purchases for model readiness.
  
  ```python
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  numerical_columns = ['total_play_time', 'avg_session_time', 'games_played', 'in_game_purchases', 
                       'last_login', 'friend_count', 'daily_play_time', 'number_of_sessions', 'social_interactions', 'achievement_points']
  df[numerical_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_columns])
  ```

### 4. **Train-Test Split**
- **Process**: The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets to evaluate model performance.
  
  ```python
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```

### 5. **Model Training**
- **Process**: Two machine learning models were trained: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**. These models were used to predict whether a user would churn based on the available features.
  
  ```python
  logistic_model = LogisticRegression()
  rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
  logistic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- **Process**: Both models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of overall accuracy and F1 score.
  
  ```python
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  prec = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
  rec = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
  ```

  **Evaluation Results** (Example):
  - Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.78
  - Random Forest Accuracy: 0.84
  - Random Forest F1 Score: 0.81

### 7. **Feature Importance**
- **Process**: The feature importance was extracted from the Random Forest model, revealing that key factors like `total_play_time`, `games_played`, and `social_interactions` were the most important features in predicting churn.
  
  ```python
  importance = rf_model.feature_importances_
  sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=importance_df)
  ```

## Insights from Data Analysis

### Q1: **Churn Rate Analysis by Age Group**
- **Insight**: The churn rate is highest for the 55-59 age group (33.36%) and lowest for the 35-44 group (30.45%). However, churn rates are relatively consistent across all age groups with a low standard deviation.
  
  **Visualization**: A bar chart was used to display churn rates by age group.

### Q2: **Average Session Time by Game Genre**
- **Insight**: RPG games have the highest average session time (64.71 minutes), while simulation games have the lowest (63.65 minutes). Differences between game genres are minor, with an average session time around 64 minutes for all genres.

  **Visualization**: Bar charts visualize the session times per genre.

### Q3: **Correlation Between Games Played and Churn**
- **Insight**: A correlation of -0.0018 suggests that playing more games has an insignificant impact on reducing churn.

### Q4: **In-Game Purchases vs. Churn**
- **Insight**: Non-churned users spent slightly more on in-game purchases than churned users. This indicates that users who spend more are slightly less likely to churn, but the difference is marginal.

  **Visualization**: A bar chart displayed in-game purchases for churned vs. non-churned users.

### Q5: **Impact of Social Interactions on Churn**
- **Insight**: Social interactions showed fluctuating churn rates without a clear linear relationship, indicating that while social engagement may play a role, it does not directly reduce churn rates consistently.

  **Visualization**: A line chart visualized the relationship between social interactions and churn rates.

### Q6: **Subscription Status and Churn**
- **Insight**: Surprisingly, subscribed users had a slightly higher churn rate (31.41%) compared to non-subscribed users (31.17%), suggesting that subscription alone does not prevent churn.

### Q7: **Device Type and Churn**
- **Insight**: PC users had the highest churn rate (32.07%), while mobile users had the lowest (30.64%). The differences are small, indicating device type has a limited impact on churn.

### Q8: **Game Mode Influence on Play Time**
- **Insight**: Multiplayer mode leads to the highest total playtime, but single-player mode has the highest daily playtime. The differences in playtime across game modes are minor, with consistent variability.

### Q9: **Max Level Achieved Across Countries**
- **Insight**: Max level achievements are fairly consistent across countries, with mean levels ranging from 24 to 26. This suggests a similar level of user engagement across different regions.

### Q10: **Number of Sessions for Churned Users**
- **Insight**: The number of sessions shows a declining trend over time for churned users, with fluctuations indicating inconsistent engagement before they churn.

  **Visualization**: A trend line chart visualized the session count over time for churned users.
