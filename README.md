## Overview of the Work

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   The dataset was loaded and inspected for missing values, which were filled with the mean of the columns. Categorical variables such as `gender`, `country`, and `game_genre` were label-encoded for modeling purposes.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Descriptive statistics were computed to understand the distribution of features. Visualizations like count plots for churn distribution and box plots for key features (`total_play_time`, `avg_session_time`) were created to explore their relationships with churn.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Numerical features such as `total_play_time`, `avg_session_time`, and `in_game_purchases` were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform scaling across the model. This step ensures better performance, especially for distance-based algorithms.

### 4. **Train-Test Split**  
   The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and 20% for testing. This allows us to train models on one portion of the data and evaluate their performance on unseen data.

### 5. **Model Training**  
   Two models were trained to predict user churn:
   - **Logistic Regression**: A linear classification model to predict whether a user will churn.
   - **Random Forest**: A tree-based ensemble method that captures complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Both models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to compare their performance. The Random Forest model performed better overall, capturing the complex relationships between the features and the churn outcome.

 ###7. **Feature Importance**  
   The most important features contributing to the Random Forest model's predictions were identified and visualized. These insights reveal the factors most strongly influencing user churn, such as `total_play_time` and `games_played`.
